<h1>Description:</h1>
Hi Everyone thank you for taking the time out to check out BlessDay! 
I wanted to build this app for the people like myself who have bad days 
and need some type of motivation to lift them. BlessDay is here for you to 
express your emotions when sometimes others are to busy to hear you. 

The BlessDay app currently allows you to talk about your cuurent state of mind. Based
off of how your currently feeling you will be able to receive some words of motivation.
